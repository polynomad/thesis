# Daily Note: 2022 April 20

start working at 0753 to 1100 (for lunch)

start working at TIME to TIME.

### Aim

- finish `bbox_coverage.py`. I can use the code in `geometry.py`.
- try to get a visualization of the bounding box positions in the 144 images in the training set. Or I cannot assure that it is plausible to use sum instead of union for the bounding box coverage calculation.


### Work

- `bbox_coverage.py`
  - I can acquire both the bounding box information and the resolution information in the same fashion as the variable `infos` in `img_split.py` at line 283. (I am not familiar with the feeling of using other's code. Trying to learn)
  - before that. the file `launch.json` should be set up for debugging. The arguments are parsed via this file. 
  - line 109, 110, 275, 278 are commented for debugging. make sure to uncomment after the work.
  - I am not familiar with the Python code for multi thread processing. It is vague for iterating items. 
  - `P4228.png` has no annotation or bbox values, but in the annotation file, there is only one annotation called airport. This is my internal bug, not the code `bbox_coverage.py` bug.
  - annotation now is right. Updated `~/readme.md` for this part.
  - hard to implement a union (the only way I know is to take the IoU recursively for every bounding box in one image), decided to switch to the sum of area instead of union. Left a rabbit hole to be continued. (now 1100)
  - Back at 1600. Carelessly permenantly deleted the work done in the morning. Recovered the results in half an hour.
  - implemented shoelace formula to calculate the area of vertices. Finished calculating the mean and variance of bbox coverage at 1801.

### Outputs

- The mean of bbox coverage is 0.1266428175653425 (in the training set)
- The variance of bbox coverage is 0.021419500135768814 (in the training set)

start working at 1500 to 2100.

### Overview

- set up the new working environment in demoroom.
- managed to visualize the splitted subimages of a big aerial image. See: `<thesis>/image/P3065_lowRes.png` compared with `{<thesis>/image/P3065_0001.png` to `<thesis>/image/P3065_0010.png}`.
- the image resolution is acquired in the log of `<thesis>/data/DOTA2_0_split_ss/train/images/part4/annfiles`. Further I will use this information to calculate bounding box coverage and other metrics (for calculating 'sparsity').

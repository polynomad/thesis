This paper is based on some assumptions. I need to somewhat prove these assumptions, whether by experiment, by theory, or by referencing papers.

Assumption 1: The distribution of objects are dense in a small scale, or in an artificial scenario. However, because of PLACEHOLDER, objects distribute sparsely in a scale large enough. 
- I can write a script to prove this in the DOTA dataset.

Define network efficiency as ...
Define image to object ratio as ...

Assumption 2: The network is efficient when it processes images with a similar image to object ratio.
